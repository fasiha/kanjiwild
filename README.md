Kanji in the Wild
=================

What is this for?
-----------------

This browser-based application asks you how far along you are in James Heisig’s *Remembering the Kanji, vol. 1* (6th edition) and, after entering in some text, will tell you how many Japanese kanji you should recognize and allows you to enter them along with the English keyword assigned to each by Heisig.

In practical terms?
-------------------

Heisig emphasizes the importance of practicing going from the English keyword to the Japanese kanji, and if you’ve been following that advice, you’ve instructed your spaced repetition software to only quiz you on producing kanji as output. I’ve found that it is also beneficial to practice the reverse, especially “organically”, that is, by scanning native Japanese text for kanji one recognizes and producing the English keyword.

This tool’s expected workflow is finding some interesting Japanese text, on Twitter or the Japanese Wikipedia or wherever, copying and pasting a paragraph here, and then entering the kanji one recognizes along with their Heisig keywords. The tool will tell you how many you ought to know and gives immediate visual feedback on how many you have correct.
